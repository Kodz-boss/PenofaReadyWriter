            <h2 class="writinghead">Dear Reader,</h2>
            <p class="writingtext">A few weeks ago I had been getting a
                leading in my spirit about having a worship
                session, I just wasn't sure if it was meant
                to be with people or just myself. Eventually
                after praying about it, I had it with my
                friends. For me, I've realized that
                occasionally I need to set myself in an
                atmosphere where I can just bask in the
                presence of God for a while and just allow
                His Spirit envelope me. It's perfectly okay
                to need that sometimes. It ignites or
                rather, rekindles a fire in you.
                Now, I Was talking to a friend and Ijust
                heard in my Spirit "rekindled fire" and I
                was a bit confused for a while so I
                meditated on it. I realized that the worship
                session we had was to rekindle a fireinside us, inside me. For a while | thought
                that once that fire is ignited, nothing can
                happen to it. It's just going to remain as
                bright as it should be for fire. Naturally, if
                you don't put out a fire it will eventually go
                out on its own. You can either extinguish it
                by pouring water or using an actual
                extinguisher or you can leave it for a while
                and watch how it disappears or you can
                add things that will allow the fire burn
                even more.
                Relating this to our walk with Christ, you
                can either let the fire that burns in you for
                God die by allowing the world sit in your
                heart, by allowing unnecessary things
                distract you or you can let that fire burn
                even brighter by constantly feeding
                yourselves with the word of God, praying consistently, praise and worshiping God as
                much as you can. <b>(SIDE NOTE: In as
                much as you shouldn't underestimate
                the power of prayer, never ever
                underestimate the power of your worship
                and thanksgiving as well)</b>
                It's very easy to let the things of the world
                distract you, it's so easy and tempting but
                my dearly beloved, do not conform to the
                teachings of the world. You can't do this
                on your own, it's easy to say "l want to
                burn for God" or "I want to rekindle my
                fire", it's very easy but you cannot do it
                without the help of God. A friend of mine
                said "Let the Holy Spirit be your 911
                before your friend" and that really stuck
                with me. You want to burn more for God?
                Talk to the Holy Spirit. He's the first you should tell. God is patiently waiting for you to run to
                Him and talk to Him. Let Him help you
                rekindle that fire so you can burn more for
                Him. Allow yourself to be helped by God.
                Let your altar burn with fire!
                I genuinely believe that this has blessed
                you in more ways than one and l pray that
                it stirs something inside you to rekindle
                that fire today.
                I love every single one of you with my
                entire heart and I know for a fact, I am
                certain that God loves you even more'
